# MIDI_Keyboard_Control
Use MIDI keyboard as regular keyboard for typing

### TODO List
- [ ] Add a dictionary for the input, use a array, and each position is mapped to a MIDI input value
- [ ] A GUI interface for the user to assign desired outputs for every MIDI value; allow keyboard shortcuts by input a string, i.e. copy as control+c / command+c
- [ ] A method that breaks up the user input string into individual key strokes
